# Preface
This bash profile is an implementation for Mac OSX and Linux. In terms of aesthetics, I have adopted the Solarized colortheme in honor of my 1996 Jeep Cherokee. The prompt utilizes some simple git functions to display repository information and uses pretty colors, because user experience matters. Custom command line tools are defined in `.bash_tools/`. `$DOTFILES` and `$XDG_[CACHE|CONFIG|DATA]_HOME` are honored, but default to `$HOME`.
